Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Analysis of Republican and Democratic by Inspecting Inaugural Speeches  
+ This project is conducted by Siyi Tao

+ Project summary: Republican Party and Democratic Party have been the hottest two political parties in the history of America, since the president of America usually comes from these two parties. To understand more about Republican Party and Democratic Party, we would like to do some research on each president's inauguration speeches. This project is supposed to answer one significant question: What are the differences and similarities between Republican Party and Democratic Party?
